    "Train your classifiers using the setting (not all metrics are needed) described in the empirical study by Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil. You are supposed to reproduce consistent results as in the paper. However, do expect some small variations. When evaluating the algorithms, you don’t need to use all the metrics that were reported in the paper. Using one metric, e.g. the classification accuracy, is sufficient. Please report the cross-validated classification results with the corresponding learned hyper-parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that since you are choosing your own libraries for the classifiers, there are implementation details that will affect the classification results. Even the same SVM but with different implementations, you won't be able to see identical results when trained on the same dataset. Therefore, don't expect the identical results as those in the paper, as you are probably using a subset and not all the features. If you see a bit difference in ranking, it should ok but the overall trend should be consistent, e.g. random forest should do well, more training data leads to better results, knn is not necessarily very bad etc.\n",

    "If you compute accuracy and follow the basic requirement picking 3 classifiers and 3 datasets. You are looking at 3 trials X 3 classifiers X 3 datasets X 3 partitions (20/80, 50/50, 80/20). Each time you always report the best accuracy under the chosen hyper-parameter. Since for the accuracy is averaged among three 3 trials to rank order the classifiers, you will report 3 classifiers X 3 datasets X 3 partitions  (20/80, 50/50, 80/20)  X 3. accuracies (train, validation, test). When trying to debug, always try to see the training accuracy to see if you are able to at least push the training accuracy high (to overfit the data) as a sanity check making sure your implementation is correct. The heatmaps for your hyper-parameters are the details that do not need to be too carefully compared with. The searching for the hyper-parameters is internal and the final conclusion about the classifiers is based on the best hyper-parameter you have obtained for each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the exact data setting might have changed, the specific parameters and hyper-parameters reported in Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil paper serve as a guideline but you don't need to try all of them. You can try a few standard ones, as long as your classification results are reasonable. If you pick the multi-layer perceptron as one of your classifiers, note that you may need to increase the number of layers to e.g. 3 and create more neurons in each layer to attain good results, for some datasets.\n",

    "Note that if you do well by satisfying the minimum requirement e.g. 3 classifiers on 3 datasets with cross-validation, you will receive a decent score but not the full 100 points. We are looking for something a bit more and please see the guideline below.\n",
    "\n",
    "When reporting the experimental results, there are two main sets of comparisons we are looking for:\n",
    "a. For each dataset on each paritition, show the comparison for different algorithms, and hopefully be consistent with the findings in the paper with Random Forests being the best etc.\n",
    "b. For each classifier on each partition, show the comparison on different partitions and you are supposed to show the increase of test accuracy (decrease of test error) with more training data and less test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the performance and function calls vary due to the particular ML libraries you are using. For example, the same SVM classifier provided in different toolboxes might result in different errors even trained on the same dataset. But the overall differences should be reasonable and interpretable. You may obtain a ranking that is somewhat different from that in the paper, due to differences in detailed implementation of the classifiers, different training sizes, features ect. But the overall trend should be explainable. For example, random forest usually has a pretty good performance; knn might not be as bad as you had thought, kernel-based SVM is sometimes sensitive to the hyper-parameters; using more data in training will lead to improvement, especially on difficult cases.\n",
